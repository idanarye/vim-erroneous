INTRODUCTION                                     *erroneous*

Erroneous is a plugin for handling errors from other programs. Vim provides
you with the |:make| command to run compilers and parse the errors using the
'errorformat' option, but you must the 'errorformat' option in advance. If you
more than one many language, you'll have to change 'errorformat' often. This
is usually done with file-type plugins - but that means you have to always
compile from one of the source files(you can't, for example, compile from one
of the configuration XML files).
You can also set a long 'errorformat' that can catch many formats - but in my
experience those catch-all 'errorformat's tend to identify error-description
lines as error headlines and create entries in the quickfix list that are
mapped to nowhere and send you to empty buffers. Not as fun as it sounds...

Erroneous takes a different approach - instead of parsing stderr based on the
filetype, parsing is done based on the shell command that invoked the program
that created the error. So, if you run "javac MyClass.java" Erroneous will
automatically set the 'errorformat' to parse "javac" errors, while running
"gcc main.c" will cause Erroneous to set 'errorformat' to parse "gcc" errors.

Erroneous can also read shebangs to know how to parse errors of interepted
scripts in linux, and it provides API for other plugins that want to determine
the error format by other means.


USAGE									   *erroneous-usage*

First you need to set the |g:erroneous_errorFormatChooserPatterns| and/or the
|g:erroneous_errorFormatChooserWords| dictionaries. Then use the supplied
commands(see |erroneous-commands| for list of commands) to run shell commands
and parse their error formats according to what you configured in those
dictionaries.


CONFIGURATION                 *erroneous-configuration*

You need to configure two dictionaries:
-	*g:erroneous_errorFormatChooserPatterns* uses patterns strings as keys.
	Those patterns are matched with the entire command.
-	*g:erroneous_errorFormatChooserWords* uses word strings as keys. Those
	words are compared(directly - not as regex) to the command broken to
	words.

The shell command - and the shebang in any file mentioned in it that has a
shebang - will be tested agains the patterns dictionary and then be broken
into words and tested agains the words dictionary.

Example >
	let g:erroneous_errorFormatChooserWords={
				\'javac': '%A%f:%l:%m,%-Z%p^,%-C%.%#',
				\'ruby': '%f:%l:%m',
				\'dmd': '%f(%l): %m',
				\}
<

The values in the dictionaries can be either strings or functions. If a string
is selected, it is used as error format for parsing the errors. If a function
is selected, it need to be as described in the next section.


CUSTOMIZED FUNCTIONS		*erroneous-customized-functions*

The entries in |g:erroneous_errorFormatChooserPatterns| and
|g:erroneous_errorFormatChooserWords| can contain functions that will be
called to handle errors. Those functions will be called after the command is
run, so they don't need to run it - just to handle the error output.

Those functions should accept the following arguments:
-	The command. The function shouldn't run it, - it was already ran
-	The standard output received from running the command
-	The error output received from running the command
-	The target list
-	The "jump" choice

The function is responsible for handling the errors, and should return 1 to
indicate that there was an error or 0 if it decides there was no error,
because |erroneous#run| will retrun whatever that function returns. If the
function uses |erroneous#setErrorList|, it should pass the targetList and jump
directly to it.

See the autoload/erroneous_make.vim, autoload/erroneous_rake.vim etc for
examples to such functions.


BUILD SYSTEMS					*erroneous-build-systems*

The same build system can be used to run different tools. For example, the
same Makefile can call both gcc,flex and bison. Each has it's own slightly
different error format, and you can't guess that error format just from the
command "make" that you use for running it all.

Erroneous' customized functions can read the output from a build system, find
the command the build system invoked that caused the error, and use it to
determine the correct 'errorformat'.

Erroneous comes built in with such customized functions to handle make, rake
and ant. These functions are defined in Erroneous, but not assigned to the
error format dictionaries - you need to do that yourself. But that's a very
easy feat: >
	let g:erroneous_errorFormatChooserWords={
				\'rake': function('erroneous_rake#parseErrorOutput'),
				\'ant': function('erroneous_ant#parseErrorOutput'),
				\'make': function('erroneous_make#parseErrorOutput'),
				\}
<

NOTE
Ant write errors to stdout instead of stderr, so calling
|erroneous#execGetErrors| with printingMode 0 will not allow Erroneous to read
the errors - because it prevents it from reading stdout. That also means that
if you want to use it under windows you need to either have tee installed or
to use Emake, Ebuild, Elmake or Elbuild when running Ant compilations.  Using
Erun or Elrun without tee installed will result in Erroneous unable to get the
stdout from Ant, preventing it from reading and parsing the errors.



COMMANDS                      *erroneous-commands*

										*erroneous-Emake*
Emake[!] [argument]		Like running |:make| on the argument, but
						auto-detects the error format.

										*erroneous-Elmake*
Elmake[!] [argument]   	Like Emake, but uses the location list.

										*erroneous-Ebuild*
Ebuild[!] [argument]	Run the argument as shell command(not using 'makeprg')
						and auto-detect the error format.

										*erroneous-Elbuild*
Elbuild[!] [argument]  	Like Ebuild, but uses the location list.

										*erroneous-Erun*
Erun[!] [argument]		Run the argument as shell command(not using 'makeprg')
						and auto-detect the error format. If there were no
						errors, do not alter the error list. In Windows, opens
						a shell window to run the command.

										*erroneous-Elrun*
Elrun[!] [argument]   	Like Erun, but uses the location list.

All commands take a single argument and jump to the first errror unless [!] is given.

FUNCTIONS					  *erroneous-functions* *erroneous-api*


erroneous#run(command,clearIfNoError,errorPrintingMode,targetList,jump) *erroneous#run*
				This is the function the commands call. It runs a shell
				command, determines the error format, and updates the error
				list.
				-command			The shell command to run
				-clearIfNoError		1 to clear the error list if there were no
									errors
                -errorPrintingMode	0 to not print any errors
									1 to echo the errors after the program
									  is done
									2 to use "tee" to print the errors while
									  the program runs(requires "tee")
									3 to run the entire command silently, and
									  print both stdout and stderr after the
									  shell is done
                -targetList         1 for the |quickfix| list
                                    2 for the |locations-list|
                -jump				1 to jump to the first error

erroneous#handleCommandResults                       *erroneous#handleCommandResults*
				This function can be called after running the command to
				handle the errors. It's useful when using
				|erroneous-customized-functions| that handle with build
				system, because after you discover what command the build
				system called that cause the error you want to run this
				function again with that command.
				-command			The shell command that was ran. Doesn't
									actually run it
                -output				The lines from stdout when the command was
									ran
                -errors				The lines from stderr when the command was
									ran
                -targetList         1 for the |quickfix| list
                                    2 for the |locations-list|
                -jump				1 to jump to the first error

erroneous#setErrorList(targetList,jump,errors,errorFormat)	   *erroneous#setErrorList*
				This function updates the error list. If you use a function in
				the error format dictionaries, you need to call it manually to
				set the error list.
                -targetList		1 for the |quickfix| list
                            	2 for the |locations-list|
                -jump			1 to jump to the first error
                -errors			The list or string of errors
                -errorFormat	The error format to use for parsing the errors

erroneous#getErrorFormat(command,depth)						 *erroneous#getErrorFormat*
				This function determines the 'errorformat' for the given
				command. It uses the format dictionaries to make a desicion.
				This function can use shebangs in Unix or file associations in
				Windows to determine the error format.
				-command	The command to determine 'errorformat' for
				-depth		How deep to go in the recursion when following
							shebangs or file associations
NOTE 	this function may return a string or a function - so if you need to
		call it make sure you use a variable name that begins with a uppercase
		letter: for example l:ErrorFormat instead of l:errorFormat.

erroneous#execGetErrors(command,printingMode)				  *erroneous#execGetErrors*
				This function simply runs a shell command and returns a list
				with two elements. The first element is a list of lines from
				stdout and the second is a list of lines from stderr.
				-command			The shell command to run
				-printingMode		0 to not print stderr. stdout will be
									printed normally
									1 to print stdout and stderr using "tee"
									2 to print nothing
NOTE	Using printingMode 1 requires "tee" installed and in the path. Using
		printingMode 0 prevents this function from returning stdout - which is
		a problem if you try to run ant, since ant prints javac's stderr to
		it's own stdout.

erroneous#getCommandForRunningFile(file)		   *erroneous#getCommandForRunningFile*
				-command			The shell command to run
                -errorPrintingMode	0 to not print any errors
									1 to echo the errors after the program
									  is done
									2 to use "tee" to print the errors while
									  the program runs(requires "tee")
									3 to run the entire command silently, and
									  print both stdout and stderr after the
									  shell is done


OTHER SETTINGS									 *erroneous-settings*

*g:erroneous_detectionDepth*	The depth |erroneous#run| will use when
								calling |erroneous#getErrorFormat|. If
								undefined or not integer,
								|erroneous#getErrorFormat| will be called with
								depth 1.
