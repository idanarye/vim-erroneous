INTRODUCTION                                                       *erroneous*

Erroneous is a plugin for handling errors from other programs. Vim provides
you with the |:make| command to run compilers and parse the errors using the
'errorformat' option, but you must the 'errorformat' option in advance. If you
more than one many language, you'll have to change 'errorformat' often. This
is usually done with file-type plugins - but that means you have to always
compile from one of the source files(you can't, for example, compile from one
of the configuration XML files).
You can also set a long 'errorformat' that can catch many formats - but in my
experience those catch-all 'errorformat's tend to identify error-description
lines as error headlines and create entries in the quickfix list that are
mapped to nowhere and send you to empty buffers. Not as fun as it sounds...

Erroneous takes a different approach - instead of parsing stderr based on the
filetype, parsing is done based on the shell command that invoked the program
that created the error. So, if you run "javac MyClass.java" Erroneous will
automatically set the 'errorformat' to parse "javac" errors, while running
"gcc main.c" will cause Erroneous to set 'errorformat' to parse "gcc" errors.

Erroneous can also read shebangs to know how to parse errors of interepted
scripts in linux, and it provides API for other plugins that want to determine
the error format by other means.


USAGE               									     *erroneous-usage*

First you need to set the |g:erroneous_errorFormatChooserPatterns| and/or the
|g:erroneous_errorFormatChooserWords| dictionaries. Then use the supplied
commands(see |erroneous-commands| for list of commands) to run shell commands
and parse their error formats according to what you configured in those
dictionaries.

NOTE	Erroneous can not be used for running commands that require user
		interaction, since it redirects stderr and stdout to files and only
		displays them once the program finishes.


CONFIGURATION                                        *erroneous-configuration*

You need to configure two dictionaries:
-	*g:erroneous_errorFormatChooserPatterns* uses patterns strings as keys.
	Those patterns are matched with the entire command.
-	*g:erroneous_errorFormatChooserWords* uses word strings as keys. Those
	words are compared(directly - not as regex) to the command broken to
	words.

The shell command - and the shebang in any file mentioned in it that has a
shebang - will be tested agains the patterns dictionary and then be broken
into words and tested agains the words dictionary.

Example >
	let g:erroneous_errorFormatChooserWords={
				\'javac': '%A%f:%l:%m,%-Z%p^,%-C%.%#',
				\'ruby': '%f:%l:%m',
				\'dmd': '%f(%l): %m',
				\}
<

The values in the dictionaries can be either strings or functions. If a string
is selected, it is used as error format for parsing the errors. If a function
is selected, it need to be as described in the next section.


CUSTOMIZED FUNCTIONS		                  *erroneous-customized-functions*

The entries in |g:erroneous_errorFormatChooserPatterns| and
|g:erroneous_errorFormatChooserWords| can contain functions that will be
called to handle errors. Those functions will be called after the command is
run, so they don't need to run it - just to handle the error output.

Those functions should accept the following arguments:
-	The command. The function shouldn't run it, - it was already ran
-	The exit code received from running the command
-	The standard output received from running the command
-	The error output received from running the command
-	The target list
-	The "jump" choice

The function is responsible for handling the errors, and should return 1 to
indicate that there was an error or 0 if it decides there was no error,
because |erroneous#run| will retrun whatever that function returns. If the
function uses |erroneous#setErrorList|, it should pass it's "targetList" and
"jump" arguments to it.

See the erroneous#parse*ErrorOutput functions in autoload/erroneous.vim for
example for custom functions.


BUILD SYSTEMS				                         *erroneous-build-systems*

The same build system can be used to run different tools. For example, the
same Makefile can call both gcc,flex and bison. Each has it's own slightly
different error format, and you can't guess that error format just from the
command "make" that you use for running it all.

Erroneous' customized functions can read the output from a build system, find
the command the build system invoked that caused the error, and use it to
determine the correct 'errorformat'.

Erroneous comes built in with such customized functions to handle Make, Rake,
Ant and Maven. These functions are defined in Erroneous, but not assigned to the
error format dictionaries - you need to do that yourself. But that's a very
easy feat: >
	let g:erroneous_errorFormatChooserWords={
				\'make': function('erroneous#parseMakeErrorOutput'),
				\'rake': function('erroneous#parseRakeErrorOutput'),
				\'ant': function('erroneous#parseAntErrorOutput'),
				\'mvn': function('erroneous#parseMavenErrorOutput'),
				\}
<

NOTE	Erroneous can only support Maven if it can use Ruby to run the shell
		command. If Ruby is not supported, or if it was disabled(see
		|g:erroneous_dontUseRuby|), Erroneous will not be able to detect that
		a Maven task has failed, and will not be able to parse it's errors.


COMMANDS                                                  *erroneous-commands*

										                     *erroneous-Emake*
Emake[!] [argument]		Like running |:make| on the argument, but
						auto-detects the error format.

										                    *erroneous-Elmake*
Elmake[!] [argument]   	Like Emake, but uses the location list.

										                      *erroneous-Erun*
Erun[!] [argument]	Run the argument as shell command(not using 'makeprg')
						and auto-detect the error format.

										                     *erroneous-Elrun*
Elrun[!] [argument]  	Like Erun, but uses the location list.

All commands take a single argument and jump to the first errror unless [!] is
given.

FUNCTIONS					             *erroneous-functions* *erroneous-api*


erroneous#run                                                  *erroneous#run*
				This is the function the commands call. It runs a shell
				command silently, echos the results(stdout first and then
				stderr), determines the error format, and updates the error
				list.
				-command			The shell command to run
				-clearIfNoError		1 to clear the error list if there were no
									errors
                -targetList         1 for the |quickfix| list
                                    2 for the |locations-list|
                -jump				1 to jump to the first error

erroneous#handleCommandResults                *erroneous#handleCommandResults*
				This function can be called after running the command to
				handle the errors. It's useful when using
				|erroneous-customized-functions| that handle with build
				system, because after you discover what command the build
				system called that cause the error you want to run this
				function again with that command.
				-command			The shell command that was ran. Doesn't
									actually run it
                -output				The lines from stdout when the command was
									ran
                -errors				The lines from stderr when the command was
									ran
                -targetList         1 for the |quickfix| list
                                    2 for the |locations-list|
                -jump				1 to jump to the first error

erroneous#setErrorList	                              *erroneous#setErrorList*
				This function updates the error list. If you use a function in
				the error format dictionaries, you need to call it manually to
				set the error list.
                -targetList		1 for the |quickfix| list
                            	2 for the |locations-list|
                -jump			1 to jump to the first error
                -errors			The list or string of errors
                -errorFormat	The error format to use for parsing the errors

erroneous#getErrorFormat       					    *erroneous#getErrorFormat*
				This function determines the 'errorformat' for the given
				command. It uses the format dictionaries to make a desicion.
				This function can use shebangs in Unix or file associations in
				Windows to determine the error format.
				-command	The command to determine 'errorformat' for
				-depth		How deep to go in the recursion when following
							shebangs or file associations
NOTE 	this function may return a string or a function - so if you need to
		call it make sure you use a variable name that begins with a uppercase
		letter: for example l:ErrorFormat instead of l:errorFormat.

erroneous#execGetErrors				                 *erroneous#execGetErrors*
				This function simply runs a shell command silently and returns
				a list with three elements. The first element is the exit
				code. If ruby was used, it's the exit status of the shell
				command. If ruby is not available or disabled(see
				|g:erroneous_dontUseRuby|), the exit code is 0 if stderr was
				empty, 1 otherwise.  The second element is a list of lines
				from stdout and the second is a list of lines from stderr.
				-command			The shell command to run

erroneous#getCommandForRunningFile		  *erroneous#getCommandForRunningFile*
				-command			The shell command to run
                -errorPrintingMode	0 to not print any errors
									1 to echo the errors after the program
									  is done
									2 to use "tee" to print the errors while
									  the program runs(requires "tee")
									3 to run the entire command silently, and
									  print both stdout and stderr after the
									  shell is done


OTHER SETTINGS      									  *erroneous-settings*

*g:erroneous_detectionDepth*	The depth |erroneous#run| will use when
								calling |erroneous#getErrorFormat|. If
								undefined or not integer,
								|erroneous#getErrorFormat| will be called with
								depth 1.
*g:erroneous_dontUseRuby*		Set to a true value(1) to prevent using Ruby
								for running the command. There's really no
								reason to do this, unless you want to
								sympathize those poor souls who don't have
								Ruby support in their Vim...
